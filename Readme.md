Create a simple RESTful API to manage loan of e-book in an electronic library. The API should allow users to:
1. Search for availability based on booktitle. 
2. Borrow a book.
3. Extend a book loan.
4. Return a book.


Assumptions:
We do not implement a login for users. For simplicity
Users will receive a loan id that they can use to access their current loan
