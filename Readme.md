Create a simple RESTful API to manage loan of e-book in an electronic library. The API should allow users to:
1. Search for availability based on booktitle. 
2. Borrow a book.
3. Extend a book loan.
4. Return a book.


API specifications:
We do not implement a login for users. For simplicity, Users will receive a loan id that they can use to access their current loan status. Users can also use their email to find loaned books tied to them
Duration of the loan is 28 days and an extension will push the due date another 21 days. The specific timing is on epoch time. Hence adding 21 days as of the time of return.
Loans can be extended only once.
User can retrieve their Overall Receipt status by Receipt Id or Email
User can extend book due dates only BEFORE the return date of the book.
